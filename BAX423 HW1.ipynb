    "Below are some the ideas that really resonated with me, along with additional comments wherever applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the interesting ideas that really resonated with me is the fact the Donald Rubin stresses on the fact that **Randomized Experiments and Observational studies are less of a dichotomy but rather on continuum of whether the situation is well-suited for causal inferences or not**. Or in other words, a poorly designed or low quality randomized experiement could provide less accurate Causal inference than a very well designed \"hidden experiment\"-finding in observational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another vital thing that **'Design trumps Analysis'**. As an example, he mentions that while designing the observational study groups, its important not to implement outcome data during design phase (**'No outcome data in sight'**) so that proper fidelity is maintained in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The paper also provides good examples of what a **badly designed causal study from observational data looks like**. The author gives the example of the **U.S. Tobacco litigation** and goes on to show how the treatment (Smokers) and control(non-smokers) groups used to make a case of impact of differential healthcare impact and cost on these **two groups are 'not equivalent' or 'like' each other in terms of distribution of background variables**. He works on proving his point by a careful study of all the covariates used (based on what was legally allowed by the court for usage) and their subclassification and matching based on them, that the effects ultimately studied cannot be deemed causal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally to conclude, the paper outlines a very **good outline how to perform the 'assignment' phase of the RCM (Rubin Causal Model)**. How to define the units, treatments, covariates, considerations of SUTVA assumptions and an array of ideas that need to be concretly verified before making causal analysis on the observational data.\n",
